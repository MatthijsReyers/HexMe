# Contributing to HexMe

Hexme is licensed under the MIT license, this means its code is open source and you may contribute to it! 
Because Hexme started / still is a personal project that I do not expect to recieve much attention, 
the rules for contributing are quite relaxed. 
All I ask is that if you make a pull request or open an issue, 
you make sure to give a good description of what code you have changed or what issue you are experiencing. 


Thank you for reading the contribution guidelines!
